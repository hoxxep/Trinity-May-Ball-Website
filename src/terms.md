# TICKET TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Applicants and attendees are deemed to have accepted the terms and conditions contained within this document which will be on the ticketing website. In the event of any dispute, the decision of the Committee is final.

##AMENDMENT TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS

We reserve the right to amend, add and/or replace any of these terms and conditions. Any such alteration will be published on the Trinity May Ball website prior to the Ball.

## TICKET ELIGIBILITY

Only current members of Trinity College, alumni of Trinity College, or current members of the University of Cambridge may apply for tickets. Guests must be bona fide acquaintances of ticket holders, but need not be connected with the University. The Committee reserves the right to withdraw tickets from any applicant found breaking these terms and conditions. Tickets may be transferable subject to the conditions listed below and at the discretion of the Committee. All guests must be aged eighteen or over on the night of the Ball and be prepared to show valid photographic identification as proof.

## TICKET ALLOCATION & PRICES
All tickets are sold as “doubles” (i.e. to admit two people). It is not possible to purchase single tickets.

For allocation purposes, applicants will be assigned one of three mutually exclusive categories: “internal” for Trinity College students, “alumni” for Trinity College alumni or “external” for general members of the University of Cambridge.

No application guarantees the allocation of a ticket to the event. The Committee have set quotas for ticket allocation based upon applicant category, and applications shall be considered with relation to this quota. Where the number of applications exceeds the assigned quota, a ballot system shall be used to determine allocation.

Trinity College students may apply for one internal double at the reduced price of £330. Trinity College students may also apply for one second double, subject to the conditions listed below. Internal and second double sales will be open at midday on 8th February 2016 and close at midday on 15th February 2016.

Alumni of Trinity College may apply for one alumni double at the standard price of £410. Alumni double sales will be open at midday on 8th February 2016 and close at midday on 15th February 2016.

Current resident members of the University may apply for one external double at the standard price of £380. External double sales will be open at midday on 15th February 2016 and close at midday on 22nd February 2016.

## TICKET APPLICATION

All applications must be made online via www.trinityball.co.uk. If an application is submitted with incorrect or misleading details, it shall be rendered void. Any change in applicant details (such as change of address) must thus be communicated to the Ticketing Officer at the earliest opportunity. By submitting an application, the applicant agrees to have his or her details stored electronically. The details shall under no circumstances be passed onto any third party and shall remain confidential.

Confirmation of application will be generated online by the ticketing system supplying with a unique reference number; applicants are strongly advised to keep this number private and not disclose it to anyone.

Payments may only be made via Bank Transfer. When applying, payment instructions will be issued. You will not be required to pay until your ticket has been approved. Once your ticket has been approved, we require payment within seven days. Please make sure instructions are followed closely, paying close attention to reference number, amount and bank details. Should the Ticketing Officer be unable to clearly identify the transaction into the Trinity May Ball account with the appropriate ticket applicant, the Committee reserves the right to assume no payment has been made.

You will be sent payment receipts via email shortly after making your payment. If this is not the case, please contact the Ticketing Officer.

## SECOND DOUBLES

All Trinity College students may apply for one second double at the standard price of £380.  The person named on the second double must be a bona fide acquaintance, and the Committee reserves the right to withdraw tickets from those found breaking this condition.

Unsuccessful applicants will automatically be added to the waiting list. Unless otherwise informed, we assume that applicants for more than one double ticket are prepared to accept one double ticket only.

## ALUMNI DOUBLE

A limited number of doubles has been reserved for Trinity College alumni at the standard price of £410. These will be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis during the alumni double window. Relevant information regarding alumni tickets will be distributed through the Alumni Relations and Development Office.

## DINING UPGRADE

A limited number of dining upgrades are available to guests holding any ticket category. This provides a four-course dinner in the Great Hall on the night of the Ball, with entry from 19:00. Each dining upgrade must be assigned to a double and costs an additional £150. Upgrades will be allocated by ballot after all ticket applications have closed. Once confirmed, they cannot be removed from their assigned doubles; any ticket transfers must include transfer of the upgrade.

## VIP RECEPTION UPGRADE

A limited number of VIP reception upgrades are available to guests holding any ticket category. This provides expedited entry to the Ball from 20:00 and a reception with canapés and champagne before remaining guests enter at 21:00. Each VIP reception upgrade must be assigned to a double and costs an additional £90. Upgrades will be allocated by ballot after all ticket applications have closed. Once confirmed, they cannot be removed from their assigned doubles; any ticket transfers must include transfer of the upgrade.

## POSTERS

Posters can be ordered on the ticket application form and cost £6 each. Arrangements for collection of posters will be notified by email. If you wish to purchase a poster after applications have closed, please contact the Ticketing Officer.

## TRANSFER OF TICKETS

The Committee recognises that there may be unforeseeable circumstances that prevent ticketholders from attending the Ball. Doubles may be transferred to other members of the University of Cambridge from 1st April 2016 to 5th June 2016 and will incur an administrative charge of £40. Ticket eligibility conditions apply to all transfers. Where an internal double is transferred to a new ticketholder outside of Trinity College, the difference between reduced and standard prices (i.e.: £50) must also be paid to reflect the change in ticket category. Alumni double tickets are non-transferable.

In order to conduct a transfer, please see the relevant link on our website at the opening of the window. The transfer will only be registered after all relevant confirmations and payments have been received and cleared. If the ticket includes upgrades, then these must be transferred as well.

Under no circumstances may tickets or guest places be sold for profit. Tickets may only be re-sold at cost price through the transfer arrangements described above. Anyone found in breach of this condition, either having sold tickets or guest places for profit, or attempting to make such a sale, will have all their tickets cancelled without refund, and will be refused admission to the Ball. The sale of tickets must not be advertised to the public beyond the University of Cambridge.

## REFUNDS

Full refunds are available through the Senior Treasurer until 8th May 2016. Applications for refunds must be made in writing to the Senior Treasurer before this date. Partial refunds of dining and VIP tickets will not be provided. After 9th May 2016, refunds may be available only under exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of the Senior Treasurer with an administration cost of £40.

## TICKET DISTRIBUTION
Physical tickets for all internal and second doubles will be delivered to rooms owned by Trinity College during the week before the Ball. Internal ticketholders not resident in College accommodation may collect their tickets from the Committee Room between 10am and 5pm from 7th to 13th June 2016. Photographic identification must be provided on collection.

Trinity College alumni should collect physical tickets from the Committee Room between 10am and 5pm from 7th to 13th June 2016. If the applicant considers this impossible, the Ticketing Officer must be contacted by 4th June 2016.

Physical tickets for any external doubles will be delivered to the main Porters' Lodge of the ticketholder’s College. They must be collected from there with photographic identification and signature.

The Ticketing Officer must be notified of any change of address by 4th June 2016. The Committee accepts no responsibility for tickets delivered to an incorrect address through lack of notification.

Tickets cannot be collected at the door on the night of the Ball under any circumstance.

## ENTRY TO THE BALL

All doubles are registered by name to the ticketholder, and photographic identification for the ticketholder will be required to gain entry into the Ball for themselves and their guest. The only acceptable forms of identification for this purpose are a Cambridge University card that includes Date of Birth, a driver's licence or a passport.

Guests on doubles must accompany the ticketholder throughout the entire entry procedure and provide valid photographic identification confirming that they are over the age of eighteen on the day of the Ball. The only acceptable forms of identification for this purpose are a Cambridge University card that includes Date of Birth, a driver's licence or a passport.

The Committee reserves the right to refuse admission and act as it deems necessary in the interest of safety and security of the Ball and its guests.

## DRESS CODE

In order to maintain safety and security in the Ball, the Committee reserves the right to eject any person from the Ball and to take whatever further action they think appropriate. Grounds for such exclusion include, but are not exclusive to, behaviour deemed to be violent, loud, indecent, illegal or immoral; suspected excessive intoxication; possession of illegal substances; and refusing to comply with a search by SIA-certified professional security.

The Committee reserves the right to terminate the Ball as a whole in the interest of guests' safety.

The Ball accepts no responsibility for any financial compensation in the event that removal of a guest from the Ball is required. The Committee reserves the right to photograph people ejected from the Ball.

## SECURITY STAFF

Security staff employed by the Committee shall have full authority to act on their behalf to ensure safety and compliance with these terms and conditions.

## UNAUTHORISED ENTRY TO THE BALL
