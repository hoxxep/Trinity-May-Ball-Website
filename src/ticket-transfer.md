# Ticket Transfer

The Committee recognises that there may be unforeseeable circumstances that prevent ticketholders from attending the Ball. Doubles may be transferred to other members of the University of Cambridge from 1stApril 2016 to 5th June 2016 and will incur an administrative charge of £40. Ticket eligibility conditions apply to all transfers. Where an internal double is transferred to a new ticketholder outside of Trinity College, the difference between reduced and standard prices (i.e.: £50) must also be paid to reflect the change in ticket category. Alumni double tickets are non-transferable. The transfer will only be registered after all relevant confirmations and payments have been received and cleared. If the ticket includes upgrades, then these must be transferred as well.

In order to transfer your ticket, please provide the relevant details for yourself and the new ticket applicant using the form below:

Once this has been completed your application for a transfer will be processed and you will receive a payment information email. After this payment has been confirmed, the ticket will be transferred to the new ticket holder who will receive confirmation of the transfer.

Please remember that under no circumstances may tickets or guest places be sold for profit. Tickets may only be re-sold at cost price through the transfer arrangements described above. Anyone found in breach of this condition, either having sold tickets or guest places for profit, or attempting to make such a sale, will have all their tickets cancelled without refund, and will be refused admission to the Ball. The sale of tickets must not be advertised to the public beyond the University of Cambridge.
