# Ticketing FAQ

### How do I apply for tickets to this year's ball?
Applications must be placed online, through the Trinity May Ball website. The ticketing window for receipt of applications from current Members of Trinity College & Alumni of Trinity College will be noon on Monday 13th February till noon on Monday 20th February. The window for general members of the University of Cambridge will be noon on Monday 20th February till noon on Monday 27th February.
 
### I'm really sorry, but due to unforeseen circumstances I was not able to make my application within the allotted time frame. Can I still apply?
No. We do not accept applications outside of the allotted time frames. If you believe your circumstances are so exceptional that we should bend the rules, please contact ticketing@trinityball.co.uk.
 
### Do I need to send in payment for my tickets when I make my application?
No. Payment should only be made once your application has been confirmed as being successful. Payment should be made by bank transfer and received into the May Ball bank account within one week of confirmation of success being issued. Failure to meet this condition may lead to your application being made void.

**IMPORTANT:** Bank transfers must only be made for allocated tickets. Bank transfers for internal extra doubles or external tickets should be made only in the case of success in the ballot, as notified by email.
 
### How can I buy a Poster?
This year’s poster for the Ball is available for sale online, on the same interface as the tickets. Please select this option if you wish to purchase one and add to your transaction £6 per poster. A low-resolution preview of the poster is available for viewing on the website.

Posters will be available for collection from the Committee Room on the production of photographic identification between Tuesday 13th June 2017 and Friday 16th June 2017. Only in exceptional circumstance, and by prior arrangement with the Ticketing Officer, may posters be collected after this point.
 
### I would like to transfer my ticket to another member of the University of Cambridge, how can I go about doing this?
The Committee recognises that there may be unforeseeable circumstances that prevent ticketholders from attending the Ball. Doubles may be transferred to other members of the University of Cambridge from 7th April 2017 to 4th June 2017. All transfers will incur an administrative charge of £40. Ticket eligibility conditions, as specified in the full terms and conditions, will apply to all transfers.

Where an internal double is transferred to a new ticketholder outside of Trinity College, the difference between reduced and standard prices (ie.: £50) must also be paid on top of the standard administration fee to reflect the change in ticket category. Alumni double tickets are only transferable to other alumni of Trinity College. Once an upgrade (Dining or VIP) is confirmed, it cannot be removed from the assigned double; as such any ticket transfers must include transfer of the upgrade.

In order to conduct a transfer, please see the relevant link on our website at the opening of the window. The transfer will only be registered after all relevant confirmations and payments have been received and cleared.

Under no circumstances may tickets or guest places be sold for profit. Tickets may only be re-sold at cost price through the transfer arrangements described above. Anyone found in breach of this condition, either having sold tickets or guest places for profit, or attempting to make such a sale, will have all their tickets cancelled without refund, and will be refused admission to the Ball. The sale of tickets must not be advertised to the public beyond the University of Cambridge.
 

### How can I change the name of my guest?
If your ticket application is successful and once payment has been made, it will be possible to change your guest’s name. This will incur an administrative charge of £5 between March 1st - April 6th 2017. Between April 7th 2017 and June 4th 2017, guest name changes will also be accepted, but the administrative charge will increase to £10.

In order to change your guest’s name, please see the relevant link on our website at the opening of the window. The name change will only be registered after all relevant confirmations and payments have been received and cleared.


### Unforeseen circumstances mean that I cannot attend the ball. May I get a refund for my ticket?
Full refunds are available through the Senior Treasurer until Sunday 14th May 2017. Applications for refunds must be made in writing to the Senior Treasurer before this date. Partial refunds of dining and VIP tickets will not be provided. From Monday 15th May 2017, refunds may be available only under exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of the Senior Treasurer. All refunds will entail an administration charge of £40 being levied.
 

### My application was successful. How will tickets be distributed?
For internal ticket holders resident on the Main College Site (Blue Boar, Whewell’s, Great, New, Nevile’s Courts; Pearce and Bishop’s Hostel; Burrell’s Field) will have tickets distributed to their rooms during the week before the Ball. Members of the University belonging to other Cambridge Colleges will have tickets delivered to their respective Porters Lodge during the week before the Ball and will be required to show photographic identification and sign before picking up tickets. Those not falling into either of these may collect their tickets from the Committee Room by showing photographic identification from Tuesday 13th June 2017 to Friday 16th June 2017. Only in exceptional circumstance, and by prior arrangement with the Ticketing Officer, may tickets be collected after this point.

The Ticketing Officer must be notified of any change of address by Friday 9th June 2017. The Committee accepts no responsibility for tickets delivered to an incorrect address through lack of notification.
 
### What type of identification will I need in order to enter the ball?
All tickets will be registered by name to the ticketholder (tickets will have printed on them the names of both the ticketholder and the guest), and photo identification for the ticketholder will be required to gain entry into the Ball for themselves and their guest. The only acceptable form of identification is a Cambridge University card that bears the holders date of birth (eg an undergraduate card), a drivers’ license, or passport. Trinity College photographic identification will be required to enter with an internal ticket. The guest must accompany the ticket holder throughout the entire entry procedure and provide valid photographic identification confirming both their identity and that they are over the age of eighteen. Again, the only acceptable form of identification is a Cambridge University card that bears the holders date of birth, a drivers’ license or passport.
 
### What time is the latest admission to the ball?
No one will be admitted to the Ball after 23.00, unless there are exceptional circumstances that have been discussed in advance with the Ticketing Officer.
 
### I live in Nevile's court, where do I queue?
Residents of Nevile’s Court will have their wristbands delivered to them on the day of the Ball. Residents of Nevile’s Court must be in Nevile’s Court before 17.30pm. No guests, other than the one guest whom you are bringing on your ticket, are allowed in Nevile’s Court rooms. Please contact ticketing@trinityball.co.uk for more information.
 
### What is the dress code for the Trinity May Ball?
The only acceptable attire is Black Tie, White Tie or national dress. Sports blazers are not permitted. The dress code will be strictly enforced, and those who are not properly attired will not be allowed entry into the ball.

Please refer to the complete Terms and Conditions before contacting the Ticketing Officer with further questions.
